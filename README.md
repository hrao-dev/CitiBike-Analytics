# Citibike-Analysis
 
## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process.

## Objective

A time span of about 5 years for the month of May (2016-2020) is chosen and a set of data reports are generated using Tableau. These reports aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to provide the answers to city officials on the program as follows:

 * A dashboard for each phenomena and the dashboards are accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring.
 * Basic - A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
 * Advanced - A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) with zip code data overlaid on the map.

The maps are also accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during analysis.

A Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, maps, and dashboards can be found here: [Citibike Tableau Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeAnalysis-2016-2020/Story2?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)
